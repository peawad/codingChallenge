I'll be using Flask/Flask_restful to create this RESTful API

I'll also use the ElasticSearch as directed in the instructions

To begin this assignment, I will want to connect to ElasticSearch using the documentation examples.At the beginning, I'll ask the user for a port number. By default, the port number will be 9200. If the user inputs a string, like "tacocat",  or a bad port number, then the program will immediately exit out.

After we create the connection to the elasticSearch, we will create an index called "address".
